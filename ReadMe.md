### Code of Semantic Distribution and Authenticity Discrepancy Alignment for AI-Generated Image Detection

2025-2-28
- The first version is uploaded, including the forgery encoder, semantic distribution alignment, authenticity discrepancy alignment.
- clip_models.py: The full model, forward propagation.
- model.py: clip encoder, forgery encoder, projector
- trainer.py: model weight update, semantic distribution alignment loss, authenticity discrepancy alignment loss
- train.sh: training scripts and hyperparameter

We are in the process of organizing the training and testing code. I will continue to update the code, add comments, and improve code readability.
